# Keypad

#### Project Overview

The Keypad project demonstrates how to interface a 4x4 matrix keypad with an Arduino Mega to detect key presses. The project reads the key presses from the keypad and prints the corresponding characters to the Serial Monitor.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Mega**
- **4x4 Matrix Keypad**
- **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect the Keypad to Arduino Mega:**
   - **Row Pins** of the Keypad to digital pins 22, 24, 26, and 28 on Arduino Mega (`rowPins` array).
   - **Column Pins** of the Keypad to digital pins 30, 32, 34, and 36 on Arduino Mega (`colPins` array).

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the 4x4 matrix keypad to the Arduino Mega as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Libraries:**
   - Ensure you have installed the `Keypad` library in your Arduino IDE (Library Manager: `Keypad` by Mark Stanley and Alexander Brevig).

3. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

4. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.
   - Open the serial monitor in Arduino IDE (set to 9600 baud).
   - Press keys on the keypad and observe the corresponding characters printed to the Serial Monitor.

#### Applications

- **Security Systems:** Use in security systems for entering PIN codes.
- **Access Control:** Implement in projects requiring keypad-based access control.
- **Menu Navigation:** Integrate into projects where menu navigation is required using keypad inputs.

#### Notes

- Adjust the delay in the `loop` function (`delay(100)`) to control the debounce time for key presses.
- Customize the `keys` array to match your keypad layout if different from the default provided.
- Ensure all connections are secure and the keypad is properly interfaced with the Arduino Mega.
